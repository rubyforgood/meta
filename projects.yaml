  long_description: Each month over 350,000 children as helped by diaper banks, forgoing
    their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding
    their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states
    and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going
    to be taking what we built last year for the Portland Diaper Bank, adding some
    new features and turning it into a platform that all diaper banks can use!

  long_description: "Double H Ranch is a nonprofit that provides specialized programs\
    \ and year-round support for children and their families dealing with life-threatening\
    \ illnesses. All programs are free of charge, and capture the magic of the Adirondacks\
    \ of upstate New York. It is one of the most uplifting places you could ever visit.\
    \  Former counselors, staff, volunteers, and campers currently have limited options\
    \ for engagement with Double H, so we\u2019ll build 'Orchard,' a system through\
    \ which folks can engage and build community with and amongst people who are no\
    \ longer at camp. Orchard will import a camp-compiled dataset, send an email (inviting\
    \ people to create an account, adjust privacy settings, verify their info), and\
    \ provides a searchable directory and taggable/commentable photo gallery. Camp\
    \ admins will have the ability to author and schedule automated emails to users.\
    \ Later, we\u2019d like Orchard to more directly interface with a few of their\
    \ existing systems (Facebook, Google calendar, Raiser's Edge, MailChimp, custom\
    \ systems, etc)."

  long_description: Justice for Juniors, sponsored by the Luther Rice Chapel, is dedicated
    to addressing juvenile recidivism in the District of Columbia by offering mentoring
    and tutorial visitation services to juveniles returning to the community in subjects
    such as ethics, education, and faith. We hope to lay a foundation for disadvantaged
    youth to gain the skills, hope, and sense of community needed to live a life without
    crime. We partner with local universities and other volunteer groups to visit
    with incarcerated youth at various stages of their unfortunate positions in the
    system from YSC (the youth jail), to those living in one of the city's 10 shelter-homes
    (unlocked facilities where the children are allowed to leave to attend school,
    other activities and home visits on the weekends) to those in diversion programs
    (avoiding being charged for a crime by satisfying various things of which Justice
    for Juniors is part). The program also involves an advocacy component, hosting
    a Juvenile Justice Forum annually where representatives from various organizations,
    such as the US DOJ, prosecutors, police, NAACP representatives, child rights advocates,
    are invited to discuss the year's topic. There are on average 1,600 juveniles
    in the DC justice system at any given time. Over the past 6 years Justice for
    Juniors has worked diligently to reduce that number.
