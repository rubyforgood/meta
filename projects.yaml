  long_description: With the ever increasing amount of hate and intolerence in the
    world it is wonderful that there are organizations like charter for compassion.
    Their mission is to spread compassion so that people are treated the way they
    want to be treated. We'll be building them tools that will enable them to help
    catalog and spread the word of the amazing projects that they work on.

      \ providing the details for that barcode item), they should be able to provide\
      \ a quantity of instances for that barcode. \r\n\r\nFrom the original issue:\r\
      \n\r\n>As you know, I currently scan each package/box's barcode which I've assigned\
      \ a diaper quantity to. But, let's say I happen to have 20 packs/boxes of the\
      \ same product in the mix of incoming donations-- is it possible to add a function\
      \ in which I can input the quantity of the packs/boxes I'd like to put into\
      \ inventory? With the current setup, those items would need to be scanned 20\
      \ times (which take a lot more time and leaves room for scanner/human error)."

  long_description: Each month over 350,000 children as helped by diaper banks, forgoing
    their parents having to make the difficult choice of choosing between feeding
    their children and putting diapers on them. There are diaper banks in 44 states
    and they provide about 4 million diapers a month to needy families. We're going
    to be taking what we built last year for the Portland Diaper Bank, adding some
    new features and turning it into a platform that all diaper banks can use!

  long_description: "Double H Ranch is a nonprofit that provides specialized programs\
    \ and year-round support for children and their families dealing with life-threatening\
    \ illnesses. All programs are free of charge, and capture the magic of the Adirondacks\
    \ of upstate New York. It is one of the most uplifting places you could ever visit.\
    \  Former counselors, staff, volunteers, and campers currently have limited options\
    \ for engagement with Double H, so we\u2019ll build 'Orchard,' a system through\
    \ which folks can engage and build community with and amongst people who are no\
    \ longer at camp. Orchard will import a camp-compiled dataset, send an email (inviting\
    \ people to create an account, adjust privacy settings, verify their info), and\
    \ provides a searchable directory and taggable/commentable photo gallery. Camp\
    \ admins will have the ability to author and schedule automated emails to users.\
    \ Later, we\u2019d like Orchard to more directly interface with a few of their\
    \ existing systems (Facebook, Google calendar, Raiser's Edge, MailChimp, custom\
    \ systems, etc)."

  long_description: In the current political climate where the party in power seems
    to be doing everything the can to hide EPA, climate, and other environmental data
    is it pretty amazing that there are researchers out there still publishing this
    important information. We'll be updating, upgrading, and adding features to an
    application they are using to share this data with the world.

  long_description: Justice for Juniors, sponsored by the Luther Rice Chapel, is dedicated
    to addressing juvenile recidivism in the District of Columbia by offering mentoring
    and tutorial visitation services to juveniles returning to the community in subjects
    such as ethics, education, and faith. We hope to lay a foundation for disadvantaged
    youth to gain the skills, hope, and sense of community needed to live a life without
    crime. We partner with local universities and other volunteer groups to visit
    with incarcerated youth at various stages of their unfortunate positions in the
    system from YSC (the youth jail), to those living in one of the city's 10 shelter-homes
    (unlocked facilities where the children are allowed to leave to attend school,
    other activities and home visits on the weekends) to those in diversion programs
    (avoiding being charged for a crime by satisfying various things of which Justice
    for Juniors is part). The program also involves an advocacy component, hosting
    a Juvenile Justice Forum annually where representatives from various organizations,
    such as the US DOJ, prosecutors, police, NAACP representatives, child rights advocates,
    are invited to discuss the year's topic. There are on average 1,600 juveniles
    in the DC justice system at any given time. Over the past 6 years Justice for
    Juniors has worked diligently to reduce that number.

    of the best ways to achieve that is by exposing them to it while they are kids.
    This is what the great people at the Loudoun Computer Science Initative are doing;
    engaging their communities and kids with computer science. We'll be helping them
    build an open source version of a closed source tool for high school (and other)

    organization whose mission is to promote the well-being of children, improve parent-child
    relations and prevent child abuse and neglect by: (1) Educating the community
    about the scope, nature and consequences of child abuse and neglect and the importance
    of positive, nurturing parenting; (2) Providing direct parent education; & (3)
    Advocating for children in the community, the legislature and the courts. We were
