All programs are free of charge, and capture the magic of the Adirondacks of upstate New York. It is one of the most uplifting places you could ever visit.  Former counselors, staff, volunteers, and campers currently have limited options for engagement with Double H, so we’ll build 'Orchard,' a system through which folks can engage and build community with and amongst people who are no longer at camp. Orchard will import a camp-compiled dataset, send an email (inviting people to create an account, adjust privacy settings, verify their info), and provides a searchable directory and taggable/commentable photo gallery. Camp admins will have the ability to author and schedule automated emails to users. Later, we’d like Orchard to more directly interface with a few of their existing systems (Facebook, Google calendar, Raiser's Edge, MailChimp, custom systems, etc).",

We hope to lay a foundation for disadvantaged youth to gain the skills, hope, and sense of community needed to live a life without crime. We partner with local universities and other volunteer groups to visit with incarcerated youth at various stages of their unfortunate positions in the system from YSC (the youth jail), to those living in one of the city's 10 shelter-homes (unlocked facilities where the children are allowed to leave to attend school, other activities and home visits on the weekends) to those in diversion programs (avoiding being charged for a crime by satisfying various things of which Justice for Juniors is part). The program also involves an advocacy component, hosting a Juvenile Justice Forum annually where representatives from various organizations, such as the US DOJ, prosecutors, police, NAACP representatives, child rights advocates, are invited to discuss the year's topic. There are on average 1,600 juveniles in the DC justice system at any given time. Over the past 6 years Justice for Juniors has worked diligently to reduce that number.",
